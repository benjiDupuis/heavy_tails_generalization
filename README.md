Correct experiments, with noise added in a right way, started the 2023/12/03
experiments with sigma as a scaling factor started the 2023/12/26

best exp so far: 12-12-16-09-31

todo:
 make the data hyperparameters callable
 vary the width, try to see if the double descent changes
 perturbed regression experiment
 try bigger sigmas


exps to do:
 - 3 layers 10 seeds / fine grid
 - 2 layers 10 seeds
 - correlation coefficients
 - MNIST
 - same things with sin networks
 - vary d ????
 - vary lambda ????
